I set out to make a simple acrylic case when I first built my BDN9. It has been a great design project for me and after a lot of questions and a couple of revisions, I can finally make it available for others to make their own.

## About the Case

The case can be built in 3 styles: Convertible, Lo-Pro, and HPO (Hi-Pro Only).

- **Convertible**: Allows for switching between Hi-Pro and Lo-Pro just by changing the top screws.
- **Lo-Pro**: Will be cheaper and easiest to make, as it requires the fewest acrylic layers, and you could add on a Hi-Pro lip, 12mm M2 screws, and 3mm standoffs later.
- **HPO**: If you *only* want Hi-Pro, you can use the HPO Plate along with longer standoffs and use the same screws included in the BDN9 kit.

## Acrylic Layers

This case was designed with 3mm thick acrylic layers, as this is usually easy to find in many different colors.

### Hi-Pro

1. Hi-Pro Top (**bdn9_10_hi-pro_top**): Top of the Hi-Pro lip, has holes sized for M2 screws.
2. Hi-Pro Lip (**bdn9_20_hi-pro_lip**): Middle of the Hi-Pro lip with standoff holes. 2 can be used for a higher lip, but make sure to get longer standoffs and screws to accommodate.
3. *Optional* Hi-Pro Only (HPO) Plate (**bdn9_31_mx_plate_hpo**): If you only want Hi-Pro for your case and it is easier to find longer standoffs than longer screws, use this plate that has larger holes for standoffs to passthrough.

### Lo-Pro/Convertible

1. MX Plate (**bdn9_30_mx_plate**): The thicker 3mm acrylic plate is needed for the sizing of the other layers with the cutout.
2. PCB Plate (**bdn9_40_pcb_mid**): This plate has one side thinner to allow clearance of the PCB.
3. Cutout (**bdn9_50_cutout**): Has space cutout for USB port (Pro Micro, Elite-C, Proton-C all work) as well as the reset switch.
4. Cutout (**bdn9_50_cutout**) **OR** Diffuser (**bdn9_60_cutout_diffuser**): You will need either a second cutout layer, or if you have RGB underglow installed, you can use the diffuser piece to well, diffuse the light, for a more pleasing effect.
5. *Optional* Mid Layer (**bdn9_71_full_mid** or **bdn9_71_thick_mid**): If you can't find 9mm standoffs, you can use the 12mm standoffs included with the kit and use either of these pieces as a spacer. The *full_mid* is just a single acrylic piece with the standoff holes cutout, and the *thick_mid* is a "thick wall" piece, with the middle cutout.
6. Bottom Plate (**bdn9_80_bottom_plate**): Bottom plate.

### Components Needed

- BDN9 Kit: Follow the [BDN9 Build Guide](https://docs.keeb.io/bdn9-build-guide/), but you will not be using the plates and standoffs.
- Standoffs
  - Hi-Pro + Lo-Pro: [9mm M2 standoffs](https://keeb.io/products/m2-screws-and-standoffs?variant=47432051526) and [3mm M2 standoffs](https://spacecat.design/products/m2-spacers-brass?variant=13645511786538). This allows for switching between Lo-Pro (9mm) and Hi-Pro (9mm + 3mm).
  - Hi-Pro Only: [14](https://spacecat.design/products/m2-spacers-brass?variant=7803516059690)-15mm standoff if you only want Hi-Pro with the HPO Plate.
  - 12mm Standoffs (Included in BDN9 Kit): You can use the 12mm standoffs, just add one of the Mid Layer pieces. I just find the height to be too high for my liking. You can also still add 3mm standoffs to have the Hi-Pro lip as well.
- Screws: Original 6mm screws included in the kit can be used for Lo-Pro and HPO. For Convertible, you will need 4x [12mm M2 screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/92000A019) and 4x 3mm M2 standoffs for a 6mm lip, or [15mm M2 screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/95836A115) and 8x 3mm (or 4x 6mm) M2 standoffs for a 9mm lip.
